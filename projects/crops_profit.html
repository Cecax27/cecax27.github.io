        <h1>Stardew Valley: Crops profit analysis</h1>
        <a href="http://" class="github_project">See github project</a>
        <p>Stardew Valley is a popular indie farming simulation role-playing game (RPG) developed by Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone.
        In the game, players take on the role of a character who inherits a rundown farm in the countryside and must transform it into a thriving agricultural enterprise. </p>
        <p>The purpose of this analysis is to find the most profitable crop in Stardew Valley in the end game.</p>

        <h2>Data recollection</h2>
        <p>To recollect all the data in this project, I use Python and web scrapping to get the information from the <a href="http://stardewvalleywiki.com/">Stardew Valley Wiki page.</a> In the game, after you harvest your crops, you can make a lot of products, like wine, jams, oils and pickles. So I needed to get information not only about the crops but also about the artisan goods.</p>

        <h2>Data transformation</h2>
        <p>To analysis the data, I use Python with Pandas an some statistics methods to look for croop profit, and what is better to do with the products.</p>

        <h2>Data visualizations</h2>
        <p>Finally, with Power BI I made some visualizations and reports to easily watch the results.</p>
